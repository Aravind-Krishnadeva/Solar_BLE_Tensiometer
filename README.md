# Solar_BLE_Tensiometer

A Tensiometer is a device which measures soil water tension, unlike many soil sensors that only measures amount of water content in the soil. They measure soil water tension in units of negitive pressure, also known as 'tension', measured in terms of Kpas ( Kilo Pascals) or cbars (Centibars). As plants extract moisture from the soil pores, water content starts getting dried up, which increases the soil tension. Soil tension is measured by a hand held data logger that can be connected to tensiometer.
