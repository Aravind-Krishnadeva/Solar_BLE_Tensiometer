Hardware Requirements

This file includes hardware details related to the project. This section, provides suitable information on

1. Principle of operation of the proposed hardware
2. Hardware specifications
3. Build and test of prototype hardware 
4. Further improvements section

The watermark hardware reader consists of a low cost, low power CMOS 555 IC, which creates a pseudo AC astable signal that is used to power the sensor.

* Hardware specifications
* Supply Voltage: 3.3V
â€¢ Frequency output: 50 Hz (dry) to 7 kHz (wet)
* open collector square wave (needs pull-up resistor to read out frequency.
* Frequency output with sensor short circuit: ~13 kHz
